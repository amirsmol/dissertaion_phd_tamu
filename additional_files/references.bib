  Abstract                 = {Abstract This study presents analyses of deformations in nonlinear viscoelastic beams that experience large displacements and rotations due to mechanical, thermal, and electrical stimuli. The studied beams are relatively thin so that the effect of the transverse shear deformation is neglected, and the stretch along the transverse axis of the beams is also ignored. It is assumed that the plane that is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the undeformed beam remains plane during the deformations. The nonlinear kinematics of the finite strain beam theory presented by Reissner [29] is adopted, and a nonlinear viscoelastic constitutive relation based on a quasi-linear viscoelastic (QLV) model is considered for the beams. The deformations in the beams due to the mechanical, thermal and electric field inputs are incorporated through the use of time integral functions, by separating the time-dependent function and nonlinear measures of field variables. The nonlinear measures are formulated by including higher order terms of the field variables, i.e. strain and electric field. Responses of beams under mechanical, thermal, and electrical stimuli are illustrated and the effects of nonlinear constitutive relations on the overall deformations of the beams are highlighted. },

  Abstract                 = {A comparative analysis of the state-of-the-art actuators is conducted. A new piezoelectric actuator design is presented. It is compact, simple, sturdy, and leverages stroke geometrically with minimum force penalties. The V-stack Piezoelectric Actuator consists of a base, a lever, two piezoelectric stacks, and a pretensioning element. Work is performed alternately by the two stacks placed on each side of the lever. Pre-tensioning can be readily applied using a torque wrench, making, elastic elements unnecessary; this is for the benefit of the stiffness of the actuator. The characteristics of the actuator (output force and stroke) can be easily modified by changing the base, the length of the stacks, or the distance between actuators output point and levers pivoting point. A prototype has been constructed and experimentally tested to validate the theoretical model.},

Two analytical models and one numer ical model describing the detailed mechanics of induced strain actuators bonded to and embedded in one-dimensional structures are presented. The models illustrate the exten sion, bending, and localized shearing deformations induced. The range of parameters for which the simpler analytic models are valid is also established. The specific characteris tics of one type of induced strain actuator, piezoceramic materials, are discussed, and im plications for practical use of piezoceramic actuators are outlined. Experimental results are used to validate the beam actuation models presented.},

  Abstract                 = {This study presents a multi-scale formulation for analyzing coupled heat conduction and thermo-electro-mechanical deformation in heterogeneous bodies, namely active composites. The studied active composite comprises ferroelectric inclusions dispersed in polymer matrix. The multi-scale framework is derived based on an integrated simplified micromechanical and finite element model. A non-linear thermo-electro-elastic constitutive model of materials undergoing large electric driving fields and small strains is used for the polarized ferroelectric inclusions. An integration algorithm with predictor and corrector schemes is developed to obtain approximate solutions of field variables: temperature, displacement, strain, stress, electric field, and electric displacement. The multi-scale model is capable of determining field variables at multiple length scales which is important when non-linear behaviors in the constituents of heterogeneous bodies are considered. We examine the effect of mismatches in the properties of the constituents in an active composite on the overall field coupling responses in the composite. We also compare the field coupling responses in an active composite to those of a homogeneous body, i.e., lead zirconate titanate (PZT). We finally present a simulation of controlling deformation in a smart cantilever beam using the multiscale framework.},

  Abstract                 = {Ferroelectric materials often possess defects, such as notches and voids. They are also brittle and susceptible to cracking at all scales ranging from electric domains to devices. Under mechanical and electrical loadings, the intensified stresses and electric fields in the vicinity of notches or voids may cause polarization switching in ferroelectric materials. Due to the polarization switching, the linear piezoelectric fracture mechanics cannot predict the nonlinear fracture behavior of ferroelectrics under mechanical and electrical loadings. To investigate the polarization switching and the nonlinear behavior of ferroelectrics, a three-dimensional nonlinear finite element model for ferroelectric materials is developed based on a principle of virtual work. The finite element model includes three physical fields, namely the polarization field, electric field and strain field, and the coupling between them. The developed finite element model is employed to investigate the polarization distribution near an impermeable notch in a ferroelectric single domain subjected to mechanical and electrical loadings. It is found that the polarization switching takes place near the notch tip if the mechanical loadings exceed a critical value. Furthermore, the simulation results show that an electric field parallel to the initial polarization increases the critical value while an electric field antiparallel to the initial polarization decreases it. In the simulation, we do not make any prior assumptions, i.e.??without any switching criterion, on the polarization switching. The polarization switching is a result of the minimization of the total energy in the simulated ferroelectrics.},

Due to ferroelectric or ferroelastic domain switching, significant nonlinearity and hysteresis were observed in the overall polarisation and strain response. In particular, the material exhibited a creep behaviour as the external loads applied were kept constant for extended periods of time. This creep was of the primary type and could be quantified approximately using the Andrade power law. For an initially unpoled specimen, most pronounced electrical creep was observed when holding the field close to the coercive field. Under purely mechanical loading, the material exhibited the greatest time-dependent effects at a stress level near the coercive stress.},

  Abstract                 = {Experimental work is aimed at systematically investigating the non-linear ferroelectric and ferroelastic behavior of a commercially available soft lead zirconate titanate (PZT) material. The fast partial unloading method is used to measure the material properties of unpoled soft PZT under pure electric field and of initially pre-poled soft PZT under compressive stress loading. In the first experiment using unpoled PZT, the evolution of piezoelectric constants and dielectric permittivity is determined as a function of electric field. It is found that the piezoelectric constants and dielectric permittivity depend on the electric field history. The results are used to separate the reversible strain and polarization from the irreversible ones caused by domain switching. In the second experiment using initially pre-poled PZT, it is found that the strain response is significantly dependent on the stress loading rate. The elastic moduli and piezoelectric coefficients are evaluated with respect to the compressive stress history. The measured longitudinal and transverse irreversible strains change significantly during both loading and unloading processes. An attempt is made to discuss the use of irreversible strain and irreversible polarization as internal variables for constitutive modeling. This investigation provides valuable information for modeling to predict the performance and for improving the reliability of piezoelectric devices.},
